# Box Jump Animation

A simple Pygame program where a rectangle can move and jump within a window.

## Description

This project demonstrates simple rectangle movement using the Pygame library in Python.

The program creates a window where the user can control the movement of a rectangle using the arrow keys. 

The background color is set to a soothing light blue, and the rectangle is rendered in a charming pastel pink color.

The movement is smooth, thanks to a frame rate cap of 60 frames per second.
